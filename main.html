      <p class="desc"><span class="firstletter">T</span>his new Mercy playstyle
      has caused a big shake up in the tier listings
      of the heroes in Overwatch Gameplay so in this video we break down the
      biggest winners to utilize Mercy and/or counter her playstyle. Any Heroes
      you think should be on this list that aren't? Any surprise you? Let us

      <h3><span class="firstletter">I</span>s Mercy a MUST PICK!? - Meta
      Discussion</h3>
      <iframe class="recentuploads"

      allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p class="desc"><span class="firstletter">I</span>n Matchmaking there's
      almost a Mercy in every game, we do
      think she's counterable though, we made a video about it, but the problems
      are more so ingrained into the playstyle of the 'matchmaking meta' where a
      hero that is easy and powerful in an unorganized playstyle is going to
      naturally be stronger than one who requires teamwork or a higher amount or
      skill to actualize, thereby in many player's minds making Ana useless.
      However we don't think you could go down the route of buffing Ana
      (although perhaps a slight Mercy Nerf to her self heal while in Valk) as
      we easily can found ourselves in a Nano meta again. In pro play we think
      we'll see the weaknesses of the 'must-pick' assumptions of Mercy Overwatch
      Gameplay, but until pros play on our current patch, it's hard to know how
      it'll pan out, but we do think organized play makes the other supportive
      kit, far more powerful. Let us know what you think and be sure to leave a
      like if you enjoyed! </p>

      <h3><span class="firstletter">D</span>ESTROY with D.Va 2.0! - DPS Tank
      Playstyle!</h3>
      <iframe class="recentuploads"
      src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kaHwEcjA2zE"
      frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p class="desc"><span class="firstletter">T</span>he D.Va Rework
      completely flipped her most recent
      playstyle, she was once the queen of damage denial now she is the most
      lethal tank. D.Va easily wracks up gold damage medals like it's her job,
      akin to Zarya's potential to spam damage and pressure the enemy, but with
      a bit more finesse and movement to access her new lethal dive playstyle.
      The new D.Va lacks the tankiness of her previous version but D.Va 2.0
      opens a DPS Tank playstyle that pounces and frags almost instantly,
      working well in aggressive comps or with clever counter-engage (covered
      more in the 'How to Counter Mercy' video than it was here). If you enjoyed
      the video, please leave a like! </p>
